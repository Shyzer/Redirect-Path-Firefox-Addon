# Redirect Path

A simple add-on for tracing & displaying the URL redirect path (if any) for a page request in Firefox. 

## Description

This extension was originally created by a third party for Chrome in 2018. It became such a vital tool in my daily workflow that I ported it to Firefox.

## Getting Started

### Installation

* Install the browser tool from [Firefox's official Add-Ons repository.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
* No setting configuration or additional modifications are needed.

### Usage

After clicking on any link within Firefox, you can see a full trace of the URL redirects by simply pressing the Redirect Path icon on the FF toolbar. 

All chained URLS loaded along with their HTTP status code will be shown.

## Help

This add-on is offered as-is.

## Contribute Code

I am very much a Firefox Add-on amateur, so please feel free to correct any coding errors or bugs with a pull request.
